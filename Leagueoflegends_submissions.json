Welcome to my guide for the beginning of season 8. In it, you can find tips on what&#39;s changed. You may have questions about the changes themselves, or perhaps you simply want to avoid as much critical thinking as possible. That&#39;s okay! Not a lot of thought went into my guide, either.</p>\n\n<h2>What is the preseason?</h2>\n\n<p>Preseason is a steady stream of players that helps gets things moving. You&#39;ll know when the real season comes because there will be a burst of players and lots of noise surrounding its release. You can play in preseason but it won&#39;t yield anything down the line-it really is just to build hype and anticipation around the season coming. Whenever you see a crazy change that alters the game, it is customary to exclaim, &quot;whoa man! This has Riot&#39;s preseason all over it!&quot; or &quot;I can&#39;t wait to get my hands on their preseason!&quot;</p>\n\n<p>One might think playing ranked at the moment is useless. That cannot be farther from the truth (unless you added &#39;for that reason, everyone is super chill and plays to have fun&#39;). You can increase your MMR, which acts kind of like a true value for how good you are. They are the power levels of League; you sit there wondering &quot;how the hell did this guy match my ability when I&#39;m tiers above him?&quot; and realize it was an ass-pull by the writers to keep things interesting. That&#39;s why the silver Saiyans of universe 6 can be on par with the gold super Saiyans of universe 7. They have a high matchmaking rating. </p>\n\n<p>So buckle down! Take a few deep breaths and play. Not to rank up, but to have fun and learn. </p>\n\n<p>Legends tell, however...</p>\n\n<p>In the darkest depths of the league community...</p>\n\n<p>of those who <em>can do both at once.</em> I will not be teaching you how to be competitive and have fun at the same time. If you want that sort of zen euphoria go sit under a waterfall you loser.</p>\n\n<h2>Season 7 vs. Season 8</h2>\n\n<p>According to inductive reasoning, seasons follow in a <em>Season X<sup>n</sup> = (X<sup>n-1</sup> + 1)</em> pattern. The result is that season 7 gives way to Season X = 7 + 1. Therefore, we are now in Season 8, QED. </p>\n\n<p>That was unnecessarily complicated. Sorta like the old rune system. &quot;Let&#39;s scrap it and make something completely new,&quot; Riot said. And they did, and it&#39;s all super cool! Gone are the days of sorting out your rune page like they are a meticulously detailed character sheet (<em>my Akali was abused as a young child by her uncle and hails from a clan of werewolf clerics, also she gets 1.4 MR per level</em>). Instead, you get to choose less runes, but each one packs a veritable punch rather than a +1% critical rate. <em>Mobile Legends</em> did it first. No, seriously. Riot ended up suing Mobile Legends and their developer for the rights to runes reforged.   </p>\n\n<p>More additions arrive in League&#39;s next season. IP, or Influence Points, moved out of the way for Blue Essence. All the rest is up in the air. Who will be the next flavor of the month? What will be the best runic combination?

Understanding the intricacies of each will be the decisive factor between victory and defeat.</p>\n\n<h2>Fun Rune Ideas!</h2>\n\n<p>Riot has already done a few, such as <em>Tactical Strike Jhin,</em> <em>Speedy Dog Hecarim</em> and <em>Divebomber Leona.</em> In honor of these creative builds, here are a few of my own!</p>\n\n<h6><strong>Lore Friendly Annie</strong></h6>\n\n<p>Lore friendly Annie utilizes the resolve tree, to represent how the resolve of her innocence broke when her parents died.</p>\n\n<p><em>Keystone:</em> LF Annie runs &quot;Grasp of the Undying,&quot; because the specters of her dead family follow the mage wherever she goes on the Rift.</p>\n\n<p><em>Greater Rune:</em> &quot;Font of Life is the only such one for Annie, who fervently wishes there had been one for her dead parents.</p>\n\n<p><em>Lesser Rune 1:</em> In order to stay lore friendly, &quot;conditioning&quot; makes a lot of sense for LF Annie, as she needed to run very far away from home the night her parents died.</p>\n\n<p><em>Lesser Rune 2:</em> &quot;Overgrowth&quot; describes the moss crawling over the burnt, ruined place where Annie had grown up, before her parents died.</p>\n\n<p>For her Secondary set, choose Sorcery and whatever two runes you want--they didn&#39;t help her save her dying parents, anyway.</p>\n\n<h6><strong>Safe for Work Evelynn</strong></h6>\n\n<p>Safe for Work Evelynn relies on the Precision tree, because everyone precisely knows why you main her.</p>\n\n<p><em>Keystone:</em> &quot;Fleet footwork&quot;--if you run fast enough, no one can notice you&#39;re under-dressed. </p>\n\n<p><em>Greater Rune:</em> Here we need to take &quot;Presence of Mind.&quot; Evelynn is actually a go-getting med student in her third year, who competes in League to fund her ambitions. Nice job judging, prick.</p>\n\n<p><em>Lesser Rune 1</em>: Why not &quot;Legend: Alacrity?&quot; This is to complement Evelynn&#39;s positive attitude and love of long-term monogamous relationships.</p>\n\n<p><em>Lesser Rune 2</em>: Just choose &quot;coup de grace&quot; because Evelynn is french or something I don&#39;t know</p>\n\n<p>From the Inspiration (she is <em>so</em> inspiring) tree, take: </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>&quot;Celestial Body.&quot; Mmmm.</p></li>\n<li><p>&quot;Magical Footwear.&quot; Like, omigod honey, I would <em>kill</em> for those shoes right now.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Level Beyond 30, New HP Bars!</h2>\n\n<p>Are you sick and tired of being stuck at level 30? Do the HP bars make your eyes hurt? You&#39;re in luck this season! It is time to go... even... further beyond! and reach new highs. This change comes alongside an IP change. Blue Essence shall take over for IP, and instead of earning straight currency you will earn lootboxes, which contain a random reward as well as some Blue Essence! </p>\n\n<p>Lootboxes? Seriously? Screw this preseason guide it&#39;s time to make some youtube bucks</p>\n\n<p>Hey yo what up guys Pap here and today I have another video for you, today we&#39;re gonna be opening up sick level-up crates from Slick Champz dot ru that&#39;s slick champz, a dot, then ru. okay people let&#39;s dive right into it and open the first one</p>\n\n<p>aw sweet this is a common-level shard for Poppy, now from what I heard she is like a tank and I gotta give a shoutout to her designers and the peeps over at slick champz ru for making this all possible, that&#39;s slick champz dot ru never heard of this website before today it&#39;s crazy man. I mean this champ just looks super hot, she is JRH NBR for my waist haha you know what I&#39;m talking about let&#39;s get on to the next one</p>\n\n<p>OH MY GOD!</p>\n\n<p>OH MY GOD!</p>\n\n<p>THAT&#39;S a Thresh shard I think</p>\n\n<p>oh my god it&#39;s Thresh, that&#39;s a 6300 champ and I hear he is an ABSOLUTE BEAST on the Rift, my friend got one of these and he went from bronze 2 to silver 1 in a week, this is basically a cheat code you can buy in a lootbox, I cannot believe this, slick champz ru&#39;s crates really came through here, this website I never heard before just got me a RARE CHAMP, WOOOOO let&#39;s try him out</p>\n\n<p>yeah, yeah, this champ feels great, watch out you hooker, yeah ur a hooker, you got hooked by me, you can&#39;t escape dubstep ignite</p>\n\n<p>Anyways I&#39;m gonna wrap this video up cuz I&#39;m out of shards but thanks for watching and remember the website slick champz dot ru, that&#39;s slick champz, followed by a dot no spaces, ru. Oh wait oh shit man this fake plug video just became an actual plug, you can find my account at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/papayadreaming\">https://www.youtube.com/papayadreaming</a>, that&#39;s youtube followed by a dot followed by a com, followed my a forward slash followed by a papayadreaming, man is he really doing this, this is some shady stuff</p>\n\n<h2>The Flagship Champ of Season 8...</h2>\n\n<p>...Is <strong>Zoe, the Aspect of Twilight!</strong> <em>Holds up spork.</em> <em>Jams spork in eye to sever my visual connection to this disappointing world.</em></p>\n\n<p>Once upon a time, there was a thing called <em>The Institute of War.</em> There were a gang of summoners who took residence in it or something, and summoned &#39;champions&#39; to settle their conflicts. These champions came from all walks of life and times of Valoran, and the narrative was about the bond between summoner and champion, the harnessing of potential, and the tangential personal lives of the League. This idea spawned way too many fanfic about summoners calling forth their favorite champions and forcing them to debase each other, leading to Riot going all &quot;yamete&quot; and gutting it. The real reason was that it was a weakly-typed lore for a game surging in popularity. Here&#39;s the rub: their replacement, Universe, has been in the works for years. Here&#39;s the other rub: it will not be finished this season, because there are 139 champs and about a fourth of those are incompatible with the rest. What didn&#39;t need to make sense before transformed into a real problem.</p>\n\n<p>Storytelling is an invincible, infinite art that laughs in the face of sayings like &quot;these two things can&#39;t ever go together.&quot; Just because you power your house with electricity, however, doesn&#39;t mean you can shoot lightning from your hands. Riot has done a commendable job reworking and tweaking their roster into characters who can enter each others&#39; worlds. No, seriously. It is quite the feat. Even so, weaving together all of these different walks of life in a way that has one central explanation behind magic, one central hierarchy of power, and one consistent political space is hefty at best, impossible at worst. Bilgewater and the ocean. Demacia and Noxus. Piltover and Zaun. They are self-contained stories and it is extremely difficult to do crossovers. Riot is slowly attempting to pull off this proverbial backflip (like <a href=\"https://universe.leagueoflegends.com/en_US/comic/jinx-ziggs/paint-the-town/0/\">Paint the Town</a>. <em>Paint the Town</em> features Piltover and Zaun, includes Yordles, and has implications of Noxian influence on the characters. Getting to the point where this is possible alone shows years of work. What I&#39;m try to say is, relax on giving the Narrative team a lot of crud if your favorite champ has more entries on r34 than on Universe.</p>\n\n<h6><strong>Okay then Zoe appears hahaha</strong></h6>\n\n<p>What a mess. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UkEN-8xL5eM\">Wish things could go down like this</a></p>\n\n<p>I don&#39;t understand the logic behind Zoe. Who, by all accounts, does the cutesy girl thing very well. Riot pulled it off, and in doing so made connecting all the pieces that much harder. There was no reason for an Aspect (part of the Targon lore filled with great warriors and beasts) to be a loli. Sorry, &#39;ancient being.&#39; <em>So close, Riot!</em> Everything from her body shape to the way she talks and interacts with champions feels off. Like that part of your identity-love, fear, whatever-which feels separate to everything else you are. Her role as an aspect and role as magic girl are utterly divorced. </p>\n\n<p>Hopefully the Universe expands rather than implodes in season 8, and future champions go back to the trend of being a part of the universe and not being magic girls in charge of it.</p>\n\n<h2>Good luck and have fun, player!</h2>\n\n<p>Well, that&#39;s all the information I have for you. Hope you feel nice and ready to enter the preseason. Thanks for reading!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "selftext": "# Definitive Preseason Guide\n\nHello!

Seriously wtf*\n| Unsealed Spellbook| Inspiration | Unsealed, unlike the majority of the J.F.K documents \n| Glacial augment | Inspiration | You'll warm up to it whether you want to or not. \n| Kleptomancy | Inspiration | Now I won't have to run to Hearthstone for my RNG fix!\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAs you can see, these runes will drastically change the way we play League. Understanding the intricacies of each will be the decisive factor between victory and defeat.\n\n## Fun Rune Ideas!\n\nRiot has already done a few, such as *Tactical Strike Jhin,* *Speedy Dog Hecarim* and *Divebomber Leona.* In honor of these creative builds, here are a few of my own!\n\n###### **Lore Friendly Annie**\n\nLore friendly Annie utilizes the resolve tree, to represent how the resolve of her innocence broke when her parents died.\n\n*Keystone:* LF Annie runs \"Grasp of the Undying,\" because the specters of her dead family follow the mage wherever she goes on the Rift.\n\n*Greater Rune:* \"Font of Life is the only such one for Annie, who fervently wishes there had been one for her dead parents.\n\n*Lesser Rune 1:* In order to stay lore friendly, \"conditioning\" makes a lot of sense for LF Annie, as she needed to run very far away from home the night her parents died.\n\n*Lesser Rune 2:* \"Overgrowth\" describes the moss crawling over the burnt, ruined place where Annie had grown up, before her parents died.\n\nFor her Secondary set, choose Sorcery and whatever two runes you want--they didn't help her save her dying parents, anyway.\n\n###### **Safe for Work Evelynn**\n\nSafe for Work Evelynn relies on the Precision tree, because everyone precisely knows why you main her.\n\n*Keystone:* \"Fleet footwork\"--if you run fast enough, no one can notice you're under-dressed. \n\n*Greater Rune:* Here we need to take \"Presence of Mind.\" Evelynn is actually a go-getting med student in her third year, who competes in League to fund her ambitions. Nice job judging, prick.\n\n*Lesser Rune 1*: Why not \"Legend: Alacrity?\" This is to complement Evelynn's positive attitude and love of long-term monogamous relationships.\n\n*Lesser Rune 2*: Just choose \"coup de grace\" because Evelynn is french or something I don't know\n\nFrom the Inspiration (she is *so* inspiring) tree, take: \n\n- \"Celestial Body.\" Mmmm.\n\n- \"Magical Footwear.\" Like, omigod honey, I would *kill* for those shoes right now.\n\n## Level Beyond 30, New HP Bars!\n\nAre you sick and tired of being stuck at level 30? Do the HP bars make your eyes hurt? You're in luck this season! It is time to go... even... further beyond! and reach new highs. This change comes alongside an IP change. Blue Essence shall take over for IP, and instead of earning straight currency you will earn lootboxes, which contain a random reward as well as some Blue Essence! \n\nLootboxes? Seriously? Screw this preseason guide it's time to make some youtube bucks\n\nHey yo what up guys Pap here and today I have another video for you, today we're gonna be opening up sick level-up crates from Slick Champz dot ru that's slick champz, a dot, then ru. okay people let's dive right into it and open the first one\n\naw sweet this is a common-level shard for Poppy, now from what I heard she is like a tank and I gotta give a shoutout to her designers and the peeps over at slick champz ru for making this all possible, that's slick champz dot ru never heard of this website before today it's crazy man. I mean this champ just looks super hot, she is JRH NBR for my waist haha you know what I'm talking about let's get on to the next one\n\nOH MY GOD!\n\nOH MY GOD!\n\nTHAT'S a Thresh shard I think\n\noh my god it's Thresh, that's a 6300 champ and I hear he is an ABSOLUTE BEAST on the Rift, my friend got one of these and he went from bronze 2 to silver 1 in a week, this is basically a cheat code you can buy in a lootbox, I cannot believe this, slick champz ru's crates really came through here, this website I never heard before just got me a RARE CHAMP, WOOOOO let's try him out\n\nyeah, yeah, this champ feels great, watch out you hooker, yeah ur a hooker, you got hooked by me, you can't escape dubstep ignite\n\nAnyways I'm gonna wrap this video up cuz I'm out of shards but thanks for watching and remember the website slick champz dot ru, that's slick champz, followed by a dot no spaces, ru. Oh wait oh shit man this fake plug video just became an actual plug, you can find my account at https://www.youtube.com/papayadreaming, that's youtube followed by a dot followed by a com, followed my a forward slash followed by a papayadreaming, man is he really doing this, this is some shady stuff\n\n## The Flagship Champ of Season 8...\n\n...Is **Zoe, the Aspect of Twilight!** *Holds up spork.* *Jams spork in eye to sever my visual connection to this disappointing world.*\n\nOnce upon a time, there was a thing called *The Institute of War.* There were a gang of summoners who took residence in it or something, and summoned 'champions' to settle their conflicts. These champions came from all walks of life and times of Valoran, and the narrative was about the bond between summoner and champion, the harnessing of potential, and the tangential personal lives of the League. This idea spawned way too many fanfic about summoners calling forth their favorite champions and forcing them to debase each other, leading to Riot going all \"yamete\" and gutting it. The real reason was that it was a weakly-typed lore for a game surging in popularity. Here's the rub: their replacement, Universe, has been in the works for years. Here's the other rub: it will not be finished this season, because there are 139 champs and about a fourth of those are incompatible with the rest. What didn't need to make sense before transformed into a real problem.\n\nStorytelling is an invincible, infinite art that laughs in the face of sayings like \"these two things can't ever go together.\" Just because you power your house with electricity, however, doesn't mean you can shoot lightning from your hands. Riot has done a commendable job reworking and tweaking their roster into characters who can enter each others' worlds. No, seriously. It is quite the feat. Even so, weaving together all of these different walks of life in a way that has one central explanation behind magic, one central hierarchy of power, and one consistent political space is hefty at best, impossible at worst. Bilgewater and the ocean. Demacia and Noxus. Piltover and Zaun. They are self-contained stories and it is extremely difficult to do crossovers. Riot is slowly attempting to pull off this proverbial backflip (like [Paint the Town](https://universe.leagueoflegends.com/en_US/comic/jinx-ziggs/paint-the-town/0/). *Paint the Town* features Piltover and Zaun, includes Yordles, and has implications of Noxian influence on the characters. Getting to the point where this is possible alone shows years of work. What I'm try to say is, relax on giving the Narrative team a lot of crud if your favorite champ has more entries on r34 than on Universe.\n\n###### **Okay then Zoe appears hahaha**\n\nWhat a mess. [Wish things could go down like this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UkEN-8xL5eM)\n\nI don't understand the logic behind Zoe. Who, by all accounts, does the cutesy girl thing very well. Riot pulled it off, and in doing so made connecting all the pieces that much harder. There was no reason for an Aspect (part of the Targon lore filled with great warriors and beasts) to be a loli. Sorry, 'ancient being.' *So close, Riot!* Everything from her body shape to the way she talks and interacts with champions feels off. Like that part of your identity-love, fear, whatever-which feels separate to everything else you are. Her role as an aspect and role as magic girl are utterly divorced. \n\nHopefully the Universe expands rather than implodes in season 8, and future champions go back to the trend of being a part of the universe and not being magic girls in charge of it.\n\n## Good luck and have fun, player!\n\nWell, that's all the information I have for you.

play for a League of Legends team representing an official gaming arena known in the UK as Game/Belong.\nBelong is an official gaming arena enforced by riot games as seen here:\n<a href=\"https://www.belong.gg/news/become-a-legend/\">https://www.belong.gg/news/become-a-legend/</a>\nThis was an official post on the League of Legends homepage in EUW which explains how Riot can actually grant special permissions such as all champs and skins unlocked to certain official vendors.\nNow my reason for this post is that every Thursday night we have our official competitive match in which we play in our gaming arena against another gaming arena around the UK, we tend to play this game in tournament draft. \nThe issue is with the preseason and patches occurring on a Tuesday night/Wednesday morning, if there is a large change such as preseason or even something as small as a champion rework it leaves us as a team no room to practise these changes such as the runes and masteries before we enter a competitive environment which could lead to us playing at a sub optimal level.\nI understand that Riot can\u2019t put everything on hold for some small amateur League of Legends tournaments but this tournament spans over 3-4 months and one week could be the difference between us winning or losing.\nI\u2019m not saying Riot should implement a completely new system for small tournaments but I think it would be very beneficial if there was a way that tournaments could get official verification from Riot and potentially make our tournament draft played on a previous

this is going to be a somewhat long post, TLDR at the bottom.\nFor a bit of context, I currently play for a League of Legends team representing an official gaming arena known in the UK as Game/Belong.\nBelong is an official gaming arena enforced by riot games as seen here:\nhttps://www.belong.gg/news/become-a-legend/\nThis was an official post on the League of Legends homepage in EUW which explains how Riot can actually grant special permissions such as all champs and skins unlocked to certain official vendors.\nNow my reason for this post is that every Thursday night we have our official competitive match in which we play in our gaming arena against another gaming arena around the UK, we tend to play this game in tournament draft. \nThe issue is with the preseason and patches occurring on a Tuesday night/Wednesday morning, if there is a large change such as preseason or even something as small as a champion rework it leaves us as a team no room to practise these changes such as the runes and masteries before we enter a competitive environment which could lead to us playing at a sub optimal level.\nI understand that Riot can\u2019t put everything on hold for some small amateur League of Legends tournaments but this tournament spans over 3-4 months and one week could be the difference between us winning or losing.\nI\u2019m not saying Riot should implement a completely new system for small tournaments but I think it would be very beneficial if there was a way that tournaments could get official verification from Riot and potentially make our tournament draft played on a previous patch for example the patch prior to preseason for maybe a week or two just so that we can have time to practise the new season changes as a team for a fair amount of time before we have to compete with others for an official tournament.\n\n**TL;DR: Playing for an official gaming centre in a 3-4 month long tournament, would love if we could play on a previous patch when
